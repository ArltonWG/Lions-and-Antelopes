# Lions-and-Antelopes
Python Project done in my first year Computer Science Class (2010)

This is the project I submitted in 2010 with some slight changes to allow it to run in Python 3.0
The PDF contains the scope of the project and this is the code for part 3 which also includes code for the first 2 parts.
The word document contains the writeup on how the project works. Please let me know if anything is still unclear.
